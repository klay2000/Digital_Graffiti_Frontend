#Digital Graffiti Frontend
This repo contains the frontend for a project I made in a team with two other people initially for
the Grizzhacks 4 hackathon. Digital Graffiti is an art installation/digital corkboard that allows
you to post drawings to a large screen from a mobile devise. This frontend is written in Dart using
Flutter. The backend, which can be found on my Github page, was written in Kotlin.
